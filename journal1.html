					The course of web front end technology started in June 27th. Nowadays, along with the rapid development of network technology, Web front end is becoming increasingly significant in the realm of software engeneering. Through this course, I expect to master the knowledge and techniques about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before this course started, I had no idea about what web front end technology actually is. Through the first lecture, I understood that web front end technology is the technology about user interaction in Internet, which is widely known as web pages. It consists of three parts: the structural part, mainly about Hyper Text Markup Language, the presentational part, mainly about Cascading Style Sheets and the behavioral part, mainly about the scripting language for web pages, for example, JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope the lecturer and the teaching assistant instruct me simply and clearly, and be tolerant to the mistakes and delays of my experiments.
